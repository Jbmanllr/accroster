//! The core's interface: what goes in ([`Command`], [`Event`]) and what comes
//! out ([`View`], [`Effect`]).
//!
//! The UI layer never decides anything. It:
//!
//! 1. renders the latest [`View`] (menu bar label, menu, Settings, About),
//! 2. forwards each click as the [`Command`] attached to what was clicked, and
//!    each OS notification as an [`Event`],
//! 3. performs each [`Effect`] it receives, literally.
//!
//! Commands are what the user asked for; events are what happened. Both are
//! handled the same way: the core updates its state and files, then returns
//! the effects to perform. The view is recomputed from state on demand, so it
//! is always complete and the UI can redraw everything from it.
//!
//! Later tickets add variants (switch CLI, add Profile, sleep/wake, …) here;
//! everything else in the UI layer stays a renderer.
